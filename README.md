# Syntactic-Processing
Part Of Speech tagging using modified Viterbi

Followings are accomplished in this assignment:

1. Write the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 
2. Solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. These techniques can use any of the approaches discussed in the class - lexicon, 
rule-based, probabilistic etc. Note that to implement these techniques, you can either write separate functions and call them from the main 
Viterbi algorithm, or modify the Viterbi algorithm, or both.
3. Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
4. List down at least three cases from the sample test file (i.e. unknown word-tag pairs) which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi 
POS tagger and got corrected after your modifications.
